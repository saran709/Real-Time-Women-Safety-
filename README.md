# 🚨 AI Powered Women Safety Assistance Using Real-Time Image Processing

This project is a real-time women safety monitoring system built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.
It analyzes human behavior and silent hand gestures through a webcam to detect stress, danger, and SOS situations without requiring voice input or external devices.

▶️ How It Works

Webcam captures live video.

Body pose, hands, and face landmarks are detected.

Movement intensity is analyzed over time.

System classifies behavior into:

NORMAL – calm movement

STRESS – repeated unstable motion

DANGER – sustained panic motion

Silent hand gestures can manually trigger:

HELP or SOS

Output is shown in real time and recorded automatically.
